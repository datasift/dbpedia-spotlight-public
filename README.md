#### Shedding Light on the Web of Documents

DBpedia Spotlight looks for ~3.5M things of unknown or ~320 known types in text and tries to link them to their global unique identifiers in [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org). 

#### Demonstration

Go to our [Demonstration](http://dbpedia-spotlight.github.io/demo/) page, copy+paste some text and play with the parameters to see how it works.

#### Call our web service

You can use our demonstration [Web Service](http://github.com/dbpedia-spotlight/dbpedia-spotlight/wiki/Web-service) directly from your application.

    curl http://spotlight.sztaki.hu:2222/rest/annotate \
      --data-urlencode "text=President Obama called Wednesday on Congress to extend a tax break
      for students included in last year's economic stimulus package, arguing
      that the policy provides more generous assistance." \
      --data "confidence=0.35"

or for JSON:

    curl http://spotlight.sztaki.hu:2222/rest/annotate \
      --data-urlencode "text=President Obama called Wednesday on Congress to extend a tax break
      for students included in last year's economic stimulus package, arguing
      that the policy provides more generous assistance." \
      --data "confidence=0.35" \
      -H "Accept: application/json"
